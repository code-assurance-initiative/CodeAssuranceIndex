// Re-signs examples/cai-delivery.sample.json under a key id of its own.
//
// Why this exists. The published sample used to be signed under `cai-ed25519-2026-07` — the PRODUCTION key id —
// while examples/cai-delivery.keys.json bound that same id to a different public key. Anyone who took the sample
// and posted it to the live /api/verify-delivery got "signature does not verify (tampered payload or wrong key)",
// which is a poor advertisement for a standard whose whole pitch is that strangers can check our work. Worse, the
// bundled key file was a trap for offline verification: it bound a production identifier to a non-production key.
//
// The sample now signs under `cai-ed25519-sample`, which production does not and must not trust. Verifying the
// example needs only the public half, which ships in examples/cai-delivery.keys.json; regenerating it means
// running this tool, which mints a fresh keypair every time. So the private seed buys a reader nothing, and a
// committed private key — fixture or not — is indistinguishable from a leak to everyone who scans the tree. It
// is written outside the repository instead, the same way docs/spec tells a signer to keep a real one.

// 2. Re-sign the existing sample payload — the evidence and the verdict are kept verbatim, because

//    ★ THE ISSUER NAME IS REFRESHED, and that is not cosmetic. The sample was minted when the
//      standard was served from cai.canine.dev, and it still named that host as its issuer long
//      after the standard moved onto its own domain and out of the company's. An example package
//      is the first artefact anyone reads to learn the format, so an issuer it no longer has is a
//      claim about who stands behind a score. DeliveryBuilder already defaults to the current
//      identity; this takes it from the same place rather than repeating the string here.
//
//      Packages signed under the OLD issuer keep verifying: the verifier checks the signature and
//      the MAJOR, never the issuer name (see DeliveryPackage.SchemaId).
