/// "a restart currently forgets that a vendor already submitted, which is precisely the hole the rule exists to

/// result, and the published set quietly becomes "the results people were happy with". It was also the first
/// thing an unfriendly participant would have found.</para>
///
/// <para>★★ AND NO JUDGING WAS RECORDED AT ALL. 01 promises every prompt, model version and raw verdict with its
/// reasoning, published in full; the cascade resolved votes in memory and returned an answer. The claim a
/// sceptic tests first was the one with nothing behind it.</para>
///
/// <para>★ "Restart" here is a SECOND application built over the same database file, which is what a deploy or
/// a crash actually looks like. Two factories, one file: nothing in process survives, and everything the
