# The CAI mark

The band under the glass. The five-band scale is the mark's only colour and its dominant
element; the magnifying glass lifts off it as a callout, showing the reading — the pin at
the yellow/green boundary — magnified. An independent inspection (the reader's glass:
"verify it yourself") of the standard's own scale. The mark carries no organisational identity at all: no
studio glyphs, and the instrument itself carries no brand colour. That was first done to
hold it at arm's length from the studio that created it, and it survives the move to the
Initiative for a better reason — a standard anyone may implement should not look like it
belongs to whoever publishes it.

- `cai-mark.svg` — the master. Ring, handle and pin outline are drawn in `currentColor`,
  so ONE file is black on a light ground and white on a dark one; the band is the only
  fixed colour. Inline it (imprint inlines vector assets) — referenced as an <img> it
  loses the ink inheritance.
- `cai-favicon-64.png` — the app-icon cut: the mark on a dark rounded tile, because a
  browser tab's ground is unknown and currentColor cannot reach a raster.
- `cai-og.png` / `og-card.html` — the 1200×630 share card and the HTML that renders it
  (headless Chrome at 1200×630).

Band colours: `#c94f43 #d97f3e #c9a13b #55a06c #2e8f75`. Pin fill white in every rendition.
